## Overview

This repository contains a Vue.js web application that renders GeoJSON maps with dynamic region coloring. 

The application imports geographic boundary data in GeoJSON format and applies colors to regions based on external datasets (see `/public`). It can use any GeoJSON as the basis for the map and it can use a dataset to determine the coloring of the region.

Everything runs locally in the browser with [duckdb-wasm](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-wasm) as the underlying SQL online analytical processing (OLAP) database.

### Features

- Import custom GeoJSON files for map boundaries
- Upload datasets to determine region coloring
- Browser-based processing with no server required
- Real-time filtering and mapping of very large datasets
